# Stream Processing with Apache Kafka, Flink, and Postgres

### End-to-End Data Engineering Project for Web Traffic Processing

This project implements an **end-to-end real-time data pipeline** for processing web traffic logs using **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Flink**, and storing results in a **Postgres** database. The pipeline ingests web traffic data, performs real-time processing and aggregation, and stores the output for further analysis.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a scalable, real-time streaming data pipeline that processes web traffic logs. The pipeline consists of the following components:

- **Apache Kafka**: Used for ingesting and streaming web traffic logs.
- **Apache Flink**: Used for real-time stream processing, including transformations and aggregations.
- **Postgres**: The data sink used to store processed and aggregated results.
- **Docker**: For containerizing services to ensure a consistent environment.
- **Python**: Scripting language used for orchestrating jobs with Flink and Kafka.

The goal of this project is to simulate a web traffic processing system where data is ingested, processed in real-time, and stored in Postgres for querying and analytics.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform for handling real-time data feeds.
- **Apache Flink**: A powerful stream processing framework for handling large-scale real-time data processing.
- **Postgres**: A relational database for storing processed data.
- **Docker**: For containerizing services to ensure a consistent environment.
- **Python**: Scripting language used for orchestrating jobs with Flink and Kafka.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omidsaraf/Stream-Processing-with-Apache-Kafka-Flink.git
cd Stream-Processing-with-Apache-Kafka-Flink
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and configure the following environment variables:

```env
KAFKA_URL=your-kafka-broker-url
KAFKA_TOPIC=your-kafka-topic
KAFKA_GROUP=your-consumer-group
POSTGRES_URL=jdbc:postgresql://your-postgres-url
POSTGRES_USER=your-postgres-username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-postgres-password
POSTGRES_DB=your-postgres-database
```

These configurations will allow the pipeline to connect to Kafka, Postgres, and any other necessary services.

### 3. Build Docker Containers

Use Docker Compose to build the necessary containers for Kafka, Flink, and Postgres:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Start the Services

Once the containers are built, start all services by running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start Kafka, Flink, and Postgres in the background.

### 2. Submit the Flink Job

To start processing the web traffic data, submit the job using the following command:

```bash
make job
```

This job will listen for incoming web traffic events from Kafka, process them using Flink, and store the processed data in the Postgres database.

### 3. Run the Aggregation Job

To aggregate the processed web traffic data, run the aggregation job:

```bash
make aggregation_job
```

This will perform window-based aggregation on the data, grouping it by host and referrer, and store the aggregated results in Postgres.
